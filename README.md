### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th-year BSIT student major in Systems Development at PHINMA University of Pangasinan. I'm also working full-time as a Web and Mobile Developer at A2 Design Lab ðŸ–¤

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my skillset
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning frameworks, frameworks, and even more frameworks!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Mobile and/or Web Development (I'll try my best to answer ðŸ™‚)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just email me at jeoffersond@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first course of choice is not BSIT, it's Marine Engineering (I didn't know a single thing about coding or anything IT-related until college)
