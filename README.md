### Hello world 👋

I'm a 3rd year BSIT student major in Systems Development at PHINMA University of Pangasinan. I'm also a DSC Lead at DSC PHINMA UPang ❤️💙💚💛

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my capstone project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frameworks
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects
- 💬 Ask me about Mobile and/or Web Development (I'll try my best to answer 🙂)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first course of choice is not BSIT, it's Marine Engineering (I had no interest in programming or anything IT-related until college)
