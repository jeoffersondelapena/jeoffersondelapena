### Hello world 👋

I'm a 3rd year BSIT student major in Systems Development at PHINMA University of Pangasinan. I'm also a DSC Lead at DSC PHINMA UPang ❤️💙💚💛

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my capstone project (to be implemented by more than 8 universities in the Philippines)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frameworks, frameworks, and even more frameworks!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects
- 💬 Ask me about Mobile and/or Web Development (I'll try my best to answer 🙂)
- 📫 How to reach me: just email me at jeoffersond@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first course of choice is not BSIT, it's Marine Engineering (I didn't know a single thing about coding or anything IT-related until college)
